# GIPHYapp

This app is designed to allow you to search for gifs by keywords and save those keywords in button form if you wish to revisit those gifs.

The main challenge of this app was in the use of API's. We were required to pull from the GIPHY API and display the images in a way that was easy and fun for the user.

How it works is as such:

First you enter in a keyword in the search bar such as "cat", "dog", or "cars" for instance. You then can click the search button.
After clicking the search button you will get a carousel with 10 gifs of that keyword, a rating of that gif, and the name of the gif.
At first the gifs in the carousel will just be still images, if you click on the image it will activate the gif, click again and it will transfer back into a still image form.

You can then decide to either save that keyword by clicking the "add a tag" button or search another keyword.
If you decide to save the keyword it will creat a new button in the top right corner for future use.
There is also a clear tags button that will remove all the tags you have saved and leave you with a blank slate.

Ever time you search will remove the previous search information from the screen and replace it with the latest search carousel.

Have fun! and I hope you enjoy my work!
